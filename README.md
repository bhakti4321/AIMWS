# AIMWS - Artificial Intelligence based Marine Warning System

This is our final code for the Metrohacks EmpowHer 2020-2021 Hackathon Competition.

AIMWS (pronounced as 'aims') is the name of our prototype and it stands for Artificial Intelligence based Marine Warning System

The purpose of this code is for AIMWS to use a Deep Learning Network to identify marine animals, and then emit corresponding frequencies for each animal in order to steer them away from large areas of plastic/garbage and prevent them from getting hurt. 

We used Python 3.8.1

The basics of the prediction algorithm was adapted from Google Teachable Machine's program.
