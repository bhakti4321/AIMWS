# AIMWS
This is our final code for the Metrohacks EmpowHer 2020-2021 Hackathon Competition. 
The purpose of this code is for our device (AIMWS) to use a Deep Learning Network to identify marine animals, and then emit a corresponding frequencies for each animal in order to steer them away from large areas of plastic/garbage and prevent them from getting hurt.
